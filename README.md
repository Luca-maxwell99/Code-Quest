## Introduction 


Code Quest is an engaging online quiz designed to test and enhance understanding of fundamental front-end web development concepts. The user can answer 10 multiple-choice questions about their chosen language and receive results on their performance. Code Quest is the result of a 3 day hackathon using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by a team of developers:

* Luca Maxwell (Project Lead)
* Navya Keelara Nagaraju
* Kate Elliott

## Agile

Given the timeframe of this hackathon we prioritised delivering a minimum viable product by the deadline, with ideas on what could be added if time allowed. This process was managed with a kanban board that assigned tasks with either must have, should have, or could have labels. As a team of three we had scheduled meetings at the start, middle and end of day to keep us aligned and on track. This approach meant that each developer contributed fairly and felt satisfied with the end product.

## UX Design

#### Site Ownerâ€™s Goal

To create an engaging online quiz that helps beginner coders solidify their understanding of front-end web development languages through interactive quizzes. By providing immediate feedback and a fun learning experience, Code Quest aims to empower learners to build a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### User Stories

### Wireframes

The wireframes for this project were created using Canva to map out the structure of the site on both mobile and desktop view. Doing so helped to guide the development of the site and how the quiz interface would best suit the user.

### Branding

#### Fonts

This project used 'Mulish' as the heading font and 'Space Mono' as the body font. Both of these are available via Google Fonts and there is a backup font of 'sans-serif'.

#### Colour Palette

The colour palette for Code Quest was chosen to create a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. The site offers is built in a dark mode colour palette to ensure the interface is easy on the eyes. The charater's colours add a touch of personality to the design, while the core palette provides a clear and readable interface.

#### Imagery

All imagery for Code Quest came from Canva. The main graphic is of the Code Quest character for visual interest, and the other icons were kept simple to not complicate the site and have the quiz be the focus.

## Features
### Existing Features

#### Instruction modal

There is an instruction modal fixed to the top of every page on the website so that the user can always check the instructions without interrupting their quiz. The modal was built using Bootstrap then customised to match Code Quest branding.

#### Navigation

The user can navigate back to the homepage of the site at any point using the home icon on the top left. This simple navigation ensures the user experience of the quiz is not overcomplicated. 

#### Game Choice

The homepage of the site allows the user to pick the language they would like to be quizzed on so that they can customise their learning to suit their needs. Each button then takes the user to the relevant quiz.

#### Game Active

The active quiz page features a question with four multiple choice options for answers. If the user selects the correct answer it will turn green to signify it being correct. If the user selects the wrong answer it will turn red to signify it being incorrect, then the correct answer will turn green so that they can learn the correct answer. There are backwards and forwards buttons to move throughout the questions.

### Future Changes

For our project, we decided to deliver a simple yet effective MVP, given our time frame. Through disscusion there were many points, which we felt could be useful as future features. Here are some examples of what we came up with.

* User authentication - allowing site visitors to create accounts and return to progress.
* Quiz difficulty - We purpsoefully used a range of beginner questions in our quiz. In the future it would be benefical for returning users to select harder difficulties. 
* Leaderboard - To log your score and compare scores to peers using the quiz aswell. 
* Timed trials - Adding a timing feature would add another aspect to the quiz.
