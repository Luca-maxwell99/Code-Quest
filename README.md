## Introduction 


Code Quest is an engaging online quiz designed to test and enhance understanding of fundamental front-end web development concepts.

Code Quest is the result of a 3 day hackathon using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by a team of developers:

* Luca Maxwell (Project Lead)

### Wireframes

The wireframes for this project were created using Canva to map out the structure of the site on both mobile and desktop view. Doing so helped to guide the development of the site and how the quiz interface would best suit the user.

#### Fonts

This project used 'Mulish' as the heading font and 'Space Mono' as the body font. Both of these are available via Google Fonts and there is a backup font of 'sans-serif'.

#### Colour Palette

The colour palette for Code Quest was chosen to create a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. The site offers both a light and dark mode within the colour palette to ensure the interface is easy on the eyes and accessible to a wide range of users. The charater's colours add a touch of personality to the design, while the core palette provides a clear and readable interface.

#### Imagery

All imagery for Code Quest came from Canva. The main graphic is of the Code Quest character for visual interest, and the other icons were kept simple to not complicate the site and have the quiz be the focus.
